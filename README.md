# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I created was an event tracking app. The overall goals were to have an app that allowed the user to create events that would notify the user before the event came to pass. Additionally, this required using database to hold the users login information as well as contain the users specific events that they created. To achieve these goals I created a CRUD class that allowed the user to perfrom Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on the SQLite database with Android. Furthermore I created a user friendly environment where the user could input that data they needed in a friendly manner.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The two main screens for my app were the login screen and the events screen. Each of these screens are user centered as they keep all of the items in logical groups, making it easier for the user to navigate from one item to the next without trouble. Furthermore I designed my app with Android design guidelines in mind to ensure that my app had consistency among other apps in the app store. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
My main approach when coding this app was to create small independant chunks of code that could be reused and were easily able to be tested and debugged. Since this app is a complicated app it is important for me to create maintainable chunks of code that I can debug and test individually to ensure all of the features come together well. This is how I will continue to approach my app development process.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I extensively tested my app in the emulator environment to get an idea of what the user experience may be like and the test the apps behavior in a real use scenario. This revealed a lot of bugs in my code at first as I gained more and more understanding of how each chunk of the Android library worked and how to utilize each piece better. This was incredibly important as it allowed me to reduce the number of bugs overall and ensure that the app was a seamless and hopefully bug free experience for the user.

# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Most of this apps innovation was at the beginning phase of the app where nothing was truly set in stone. This required researching other similar apps that already exist to try and find something that I could add to this app to make it unique among apps like this one. 

# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? 
I feel that my login screen is a very strong part of my mobile app. I think this screen is very user friendly and very seemless and really highlights my ability to create a screen that is user friendly and quite functional.
